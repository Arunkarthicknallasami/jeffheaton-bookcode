Description

Second Life is an Internet-based virtual world where residents can explore, meet other residents,
socialize and participate in individual and group activities. Another major activity is the 
ability to create and trade/sell items and services to other residents. However, to create 
advanced items you must program in the Linden Scripting Language.

This book presents many common objects in Second Life, with complete Linden Scripting Language 
examples. For each example, you are provided with copy/modifyable objects for all examples in 
the Second Life world. These examples are presented as a series of recipes, which are useful 
by themselves, or as a starting point for more complex objects.

The recipes span a wide array of uses. Useful recipes for buildings provide elevators, teleport 
pads, and locking doors. Vehicles are covered with example cars, boats and helicopters. The 
video game side of Second Life is demonstrated with an assortment of gun and bullet recipes. 
Recipes for wearable items such as glittering jewelry, jet packs, parachutes, and anti-push 
orbs are also presented. Recipes for slide shows, cannons, weather stations, and other 
miscellaneous items are also covered. Commerce is a huge part of Second Life. Two chapters 
are dedicated to commerce objects, such as tip jars, rental scripts and vendor kiosks.

Outline

This book provides many reusable recipes for the Linden Scripting Language (LSL). These 
recipes can be used as fully functioning objects in Second Life, or they can be used as 
starting points for other projects. The recipes presented in the book span a wide range 
of scripts that are commonly programmed in Second Life.

Chapter 1 begins by the book by introducing the Linden Scripting Language. This chapter 
is intended to teach the Linden Scripting Language. Rather, this chapter will give a 
general overview of the Linden Scripting Language to someone who already has previous 
programming experience.

Chapter 2 introduces several useful functions. Useful functions can be reused in many 
different scripting projects. These functions will be used by many of the recipes later 
in this book. Functions are provided that process both numbers and strings.

Chapter 3 introduces scripts for buildings. Buildings are a major part of Second Life. 
Scripts can greatly enhance a buildings utility. Scripts often control doors, elevators 
and other aspects of a building. This chapter also shows how to create "fake" water 
above sea level. Additionally, a teleport pad is introduced that can quickly transport 
a user anywhere in the building.

Chapter 4 introduces particle effects. Particles allow explosions, smoke, glisten effects 
and many other visual effects. Scripts are provided that produces explosions, falling leaves. 
Particles can also be used to create flashy jewelry.

Chapter 5 introduces vehicles. This chapter shows how to create land, air and sea vehicles.
A car is used to demonstrate land vehicles. A helicopter is used to demonstrate air vehicles. 
A boat is used to demonstrate water vehicles. Additionally, a super car is provided that 
shares characteristics of a car, boat and helicopter.

Chapter 6 introduces scanner scripts. Scanners allow the script to be aware of the world 
around it. Scanners usually scan for avatars around them. However, scanners can also scan 
for objects. This chapter shows how to create a notecard giver, a traffic monitor, and an 
automatic door. All of these make use of scanners.

Chapter 7 introduces several miscellaneous scripts that did not fall into other 
categories. Yet some of their techniques will be built upon in the remaining chapters of 
the book. This chapter shows how to create slideshows and a cannon to shoot an avatar from. 
An online status indicator is also presented that displays the availability of an avatar. 
An analog clock, with moving hands, is also demonstrated. This chapter also introduces how 
to use notecards as configuration files.

Chapter 8 introduces commerce scripts. Commerce occurs when any two Second Life users 
exchange money. This is a very important part of Second Life. This chapter shows how to 
create a vendor, for a store, as well as tip jars. Chapter 9 continues discussion of 
e-commerce by showing how to create an apartment rental script.

Chapter 9 introduces scripts for rental property.

Chapter 10 introduces weapon scripts. Weapons inflict damage on avatars. An avatar 
has a health rating form 0 to 100%. If this value drops to zero, then the avatar dies. 
Death is no big deal in Second Life, an avatar simply teleports back to its home location 
when it dies. This chapter focuses on guns and bullets. The type of bullet fired is more 
important than the gun that fires it. This chapter provides bullets that damage avatars, 
as well as blanks that do no damage. Additionally, bullets are provided that trap and 
push avatars.

Chapter 11 introduces scripts that can be used with wearable objects. This chapter 
includes scripts for anti-push bracelets, jet packs and parachutes.
