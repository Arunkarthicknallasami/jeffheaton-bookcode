Description of the Book

Java for the Beginning Programmer teaches Java to someone with absolutely no 
programming background. This book focuses on core programming topics such as 
variables, looping, subroutines, and program layout. This course focuses on 
real programming techniques, and not using an Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE) to generate code. This course ends with an introduction to 
graphical user interface programming.

By focusing on core programming techniques, and not using an IDE to generate 
code, the programmer is given a solid foundation in the Java programming 
language. This book prepares the reader for more advanced Java study, or one of 
our other Java programming books.

Each chapter includes review questions and an assignment. This book can be used 
either as a college text book, or for independent reading. This book was 
compiled from the author's years of experience teaching the Java 
programming language.

Table of Contents

Chapter 1: Introduction to Java
This chapter introduces the Java programming language. Topics such as cross 
platform and object oriented programming (OOP) are discussed. The user is 
introduced to other basic features of the Java programming language.

Chapter 2: Installing, Compiling and Running This chapter describes how to 
install Java. You are also introduced to Java by compiling and executing a 
simple Java application. If you ever need to review how to compile or execute 
Java applications, you should refer back to this chapter.

Chapter 3: Variables
In this chapter I show you how to use Java variables. This includes both 
numeric, string and object type variables. Casting and conversion amoung types 
is also covered.

Chapter 4: Handling User Input
I this chapter you will see how to read input from the user. This will allow 
your programs to interact with the user, and prompt them for information.

Chapter 5: Making Decisions
So far we have only accepted data from the user and displayed that data. 
Sometimes the data was processed slightly before being redisplayed, but no 
decisions were made based on that data. In this chapter you will see how your 
program can make decisions based on the data that the user enters.

Chapter 6: Methods and Functions
In the Chapter 3 we learned about variables. You saw that there were different 
variable data types. There are also different variable scope types. But what 
exactly is scope? Variable scope refers to what can access a variable and what 
cannot access a variable. There are three levels of scope for variables in Java.

Chapter 7: Mid Term
The Mid Term exam. This exam covers chapters 1-6.

Chapter 8: Mid Term Review
Chapter 8 is a review the correct answers for the midterm exam, that was 
presented in Chapter 7. 

Chapter 9: Using Loops Computers are great at repetitive operations. If you 
teach a computer how to write a paycheck for one single employee, it is not 
much more complex to modify your program to produce paychecks for 
100 employees.

Chapter 10: Strings
Strings are a very important concept in any programming language. Strings are 
variables that can hold textual data. We have already seen strings in previous 
chapters. However, in this chapter we will see how to process strings.

Chapter 11: Arrays
In this Chapter you will learn about arrays. First, let's look at exactly what 
an array is. An array is a single type, such as a string. However, rather than 
just one string value, an array can hold many values. 

Chapter 12: Using Arrays
In this chapter we will build upon the last chapter by introducing a more 
complex example of using an array. You will be shown how to sort an array.

Chapter 13: Object Oriented Programming
In this chapter you will learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming.

Chapter 14: More Object Oriented
In this chapter we will build upon the last chapter by making use of the 
Student class. Many changes will be made to the StudentList class to make it 
object oriented. You will see how to take a non-object oriented program and 
turn it into an Object Oriented Program.

Chapter 15: GUI Programming
So far our applications have been text only. In this chapter you will see how 
to interact with the user with windows.

Chapter 16: Final Exam
The Final Exam covers the entire book.
